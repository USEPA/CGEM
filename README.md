The Community General Ecosystem Model (CGEM) calculates a set of bio-geo-chemical equations based on the Eldridge and Roelke model (Eldridge and Roelke, 2010). The equations have been enhanced by J. Lehrter (Lehrter, et al. 2014). A comprehensive light model has been added by B. Penta of the Naval Research Lab (NRL) (Penta et al., 2008). Hydrodynamics and transport were added by D.S. Ko of NRL (Ko et al., 2008). The model aims to explain the seasonal appearance of a large hypoxic zone off of the Louisiana continental shelf (LCS).
