# Welcome
We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to the CGEM open source project! 
If you're unsure about anything, just [send us an email](mailto:cgem_support@epa.gov) 
with your question â€” or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can 
happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.
We want to ensure a welcoming environment for all contributors.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and its [README](README.md).

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).
* Fork the repository on GitHub.

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the main branch.
  * Only target other branches if you are certain your fix must be on that
    branch.
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on main, run `git checkout -b
    my_contribution main`. Please avoid working directly on the
    `main` branch.
* Make commits of logical and atomic units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the repository in the USEPA organization.
* The core team will look at pull requests on a regular basis.
* After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two
  weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

## Revert Policy

If the code change results in a test failure, we will make our best effort to
correct the error. If a fix cannot be determined and committed the commit(s) 
responsible _may_ be reverted, at the discretion of the committer and 
repository maintainers.
